title = "About Me"
+++

My name is Andrew Gallant and
[I'm a programmer](https://github.com/BurntSushi). I work as a systems
engineer for [Diffeo](http://diffeo.com/) in
Cambridge, MA where I get to work on a variety of things from machine learning
algorithms to core infrastructure and user facing applications. The vast
majority of my free time is spent hacking on
[side projects](/projects/).

You may find me in other mediums under the handle `burntsushi` or
`burntsushi5`.

### Personal stuff

I enjoy most mainstream American sports; particularly football. I'm a big
Patriots fan. [My passion for football has met my passion for
programming.](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb)

My favorite cigar is the Liga Privada No. 9 and my favorite foods consist of
cheeseburgers, steak, pizza and buffalo chicken.

I occasionally allow myself to get sucked into pointless debates online.

I currently live with my wife, Kaitlyn Brady, in Marlborough, MA.
