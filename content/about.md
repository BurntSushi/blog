title = "About Me"
+++

My name is Andrew Gallant and
[I'm a programmer](https://github.com/BurntSushi). I work as a systems
engineer for [Diffeo](http://diffeo.com/) in
[Cambridge, MA](https://www.google.com/maps/place/1+Broadway,+Massachusetts+Institute+of+Technology,+Cambridge,+MA+02142/@42.3628447,-71.083714,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89e370a5b761c351:0x3ab9187e6e6ffeb9)
where I get to work on a variety of
things from machine learning algorithms to core infrastructure and user facing
applications. The vast majority of my free time is spent hacking on
[side projects](/projects/).

You may find me in other mediums under the handle `burntsushi`.


### Personal stuff

I enjoy most mainstream American sports; particularly football. I'm a big
Patriots fan. [My passion for football has met my passion for
programming.](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb)

My favorite cigar is the Liga Privada No. 9 and my favorite foods consist of
mainstream American cuisine.

I occasionally allow myself to get sucked into pointless debates online.

I dislike living in a city more than I dislike commuting. I dislike cities
because of their population density.


### Contact

I currently live with my wife, Kaitlyn Brady, in Westborough, MA.
