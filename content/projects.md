This page describes most of my recent projects and a selection of my
favorite projects from years past. All of these are *side* projects, which
means they were developed in my spare time.


### Rust projects

Lately, I've become quite enamored with [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/). I
very much enjoy the particular trade offs made in the language and like the
direction that language is headed towards.

#### [Regular expressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex)

A port of RE2 to Rust. It also features a `regex!` macro that will
[compile a regex to native code](/rust-regex-syntax-extensions)
when your Rust program compiles.

#### [QuickCheck](https://github.com/BurntSushi/quickcheck)

This was my first Rust project. If you've never heard of QuickCheck before,
it's an awesome tool for random testing of program properties. My Rust library
is a port of the
[Haskell QuickCheck package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck).

While randomized testing can often produce hard to debug witnesses, QuickCheck
has a "shrinking" component that tries to discover small witnesses of failure.
(Often in practice, with good shrinkers, minimal witnesses are consistently
reported.)

#### [CSV parser](https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-csv)

This provides convenient type-based encoding and decoding of CSV data. It is
also extremely fast. It should be on par with the performance of
[`libcsv`](http://sourceforge.net/projects/libcsv/).

There are some rough benchmarks [demonstrating its
performance](https://bitbucket.org/ewanhiggs/csv-game).

#### [xsv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv)

A command line swiss army knife for working with CSV data. It supports basic
indexing of CSV data, which makes it able to perform operations like slicing
very quickly.

#### [docopt.rs](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.rs)

[Docopt](http://docopt.org/) for Rust. This is a command line argument parser,
where the parser is generated by writing the "usage" description for your
program.

#### [CBOR](https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-cbor)

An implementation of [RFC 7049 (Concise Binary Object
Representation)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049). CBOR is effectively
binary JSON.

#### [suffix](https://github.com/BurntSushi/suffix)

An implementation of a linear time suffix array construction algorithm (SACA).
To my knowledge, this is the only fast standalone SACA algorithm that operates
on Unicode codepoints *and* is convenient to use.

#### [Elastic tabstops](https://github.com/BurntSushi/tabwriter)

An easy to use writer for aligning columns of data on the command line. This is
a simple port of [Go's `text/tabwriter`](http://golang.org/pkg/text/tabwriter/)
package.

#### [byteorder](https://github.com/BurntSushi/byteorder)

A simple crate for reading and writing integers in a binary format. Its purpose
is to handle endianness conversions automatically.


### Go projects

While Rust and Go are two very different languages, I enjoy using both of them.
I love Go for its simplicity, orthogonal design and concurrency primitives.

#### [Wingo (an X window manager)](https://github.com/BurntSushi/wingo)

I have a long history with X that culminated in the development of my ideal
window manager. My ideal window manager has support for dynamic workspaces,
independent workspace switching on each monitor, automatic tiling and good
traditional stacking support.

Wingo is written in pure Go from bottom to top.

#### [X Go Binding](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xgb)

This is a pure Go port of XCB with a concurrent implementation of the X wire
protocol.

#### [TOML](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml)

An encoder and decoder for [TOML, an ini-like config file
format](https://github.com/toml/toml). Incidentally, TOML is used to configure
[Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), which is used to generate this web site.

#### [goim](https://github.com/BurntSushi/goim)

A command line tool for downloading all of IMDb and loading it into a SQLite or
PostgreSQL database. It comes with an elaborate
[search API](http://godoc.org/github.com/BurntSushi/goim/imdb/search) complete
with fuzzy searching. It also has a `rename` tool that can be used to
automatically rename your media files quickly.

For example, this renames all of the Simpson episodes that I ripped off of the
DVDs I own:

```bash
goim rename -tv 'the simpsons' S01E*.mkv
```

And here's an example of searching, e.g., finding all episodes of the Simpsons
with "maggie" in the episode title:

```bash
goim search '%maggie%' {show:the simpsons}
```

#### [migration](https://github.com/BurntSushi/migration)

A simple library for automatically applying migrations to relational databases
that support schema changes in transactions.
It's used in [goim](https://github.com/BurntSushi/goim).

#### [Type parametric functions](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ty)

Uses [runtime reflection](http://golang.org/pkg/reflect/)
to make
[writing type parametric functions easier](/type-parametric-functions-golang/).

### NFL related projects

I *love* American football. Part of the way I enjoy it is by playing
[fantasy football](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_football_\(American\)).
I think it's a lot of fun to watch how your fantasy teams perform as the games
are played, but I'm usually in several leagues on different web sites.

I solved this problem over a number of years by querying NFL.com for data and
using it to compute scores for my fantasy teams all in one convenient web
interface. (Some day I will make a demo video.)

#### [nflgame](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nflgame)

A library for retrieving an undocumented JSON feed from NFL.com. It is very
accessible to those with little experience programming, but I've come to
dislike the API I designed over the years. I very rarely use `nflgame` directly
any more.

#### [nfldb](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb)

Replaces (but builds on) `nflgame` by storing statistics in
[a relational schema](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki/The-data-model)
with
[better
documentation](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki/Statistical-categories).
It requires a PostgreSQL database, so it tends to be less widely used.

#### [nflvid](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nflvid)

A tool for downloading broadcast footage from NFL's content delivery network
and slicing it into play-by-play components. This comes with a `nflvid-watch`
command line utility for searching and loading plays into a VLC playlist.

#### [nflfan](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nflfan)

A single user web application for viewing your fantasy teams scores while games
are playing. It also allows you to query for any statistic back to 2009 and
watch the corresponding play footage.


### Other projects

These projects just don't fit in the above categories.

#### [pdoc](https://github.com/BurntSushi/pdoc)

An automatic documentation tool for Python. I think Sphinx is far too
complicated and too painful to use. `epydoc` was my go to tool for a long time,
but the code has been abandoned and is not Python 3 compatible. `pdoc` is meant
to be its replacement. [It's also beautiful.](http://pdoc.burntsushi.net/nfldb)

#### [erd](https://github.com/BurntSushi/erd)

An Entity-Relationship diagram generator written in Haskell. It takes a plain
text description of your relational schema and converts it to a pretty diagram
using GraphViz.
